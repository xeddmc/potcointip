I'm sorry {{ user_from | replace('_', '\_') }}, your tip/withdraw of __{{ amount_fmt }}__ is below minimum of __{{ min_fmt }}__. I cannot process very small transactions because of high network fee requirement.

If you really need to withdraw this amount, try depositing some {{ coin_name }}s to meet the minimum limit, then withdrawing everything.
